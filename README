FUEL CMS Modules
================
I have created some of the modules for my own freelance work , just share it and open source it, giving back to the FUEL CMS community. There are few more modules in my mind which I going to release it here.

Group Access
------------
I remember see the group access feature discussion in the forum , so I build this to allow user set the batch permission easily.

### changelog
1.1 
* update the db scheme name
* added permission to access group access module
* change the url path name


### Installation
* Unzip the group_access folder to /fuel/modules/
* Setup the mysql db from the install folder
* Add "group_access" to $config['modules_allowed'] @ /fuel/application/config/My_fuel.php
* You should see the new "Group Access" option showing @ Manage.

Contributing
------------
I m still learning on both FUEL CMS and CodeIgniter , let me know if there are bugs or better way to code.
